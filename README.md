# Client Project: Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard

![Data to Dashboard Showcase](https://i.imgur.com/gD5Z2L7.png)

This repository showcases a client-based project focused on transforming raw data into an insightful and interactive data visualization using Tableau. The project involved comprehensive data cleaning, manipulation, and processing to derive meaningful insights and present them in a user-friendly dashboard.

***

## üìú Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to take a complex and raw dataset provided by the client, and A-to-Z, handle the entire data pipeline. This included:
* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Identifying and correcting errors, handling missing values, and structuring the data for analysis.
* **Data Manipulation & Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables and transforming existing ones to uncover deeper insights.
* **Data Visualization & Dashboarding:** Building a fully interactive and insightful dashboard in Tableau to help the client understand key trends, patterns, and performance metrics at a glance.

***

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps & Methodology

1.  **Data Extraction:** The initial step involved sourcing the raw data from the client's files.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Using tools like Python (with Pandas) and Excel, the dataset was rigorously cleaned to handle inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values.
3.  **Data Processing:** The cleaned data was then processed and aggregated to prepare it for visualization. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were calculated and complex relationships were simplified.
4.  **Dashboard Creation in Tableau:** The processed data was imported into Tableau, where an interactive dashboard was built. The dashboard includes dynamic filters, tooltips, and multiple views to allow for easy data exploration.

## üìä The Interactive Dashboard

The final output is a powerful, interactive Tableau dashboard that allows the client to explore their data dynamically.
